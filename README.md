We, Akshatha, Indhu, Deepthi, Mohith, and Jayanth, from Global Academy of Technology, are honored to participate in the Intel Unnati Industrial Training Program. As part of this prestigious initiative, we were assigned the challenging project of implementing password protection using Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX).

Initially, we faced a significant challenge due to the lack of adequate resources to fully execute our project. On guidance from Intel Unnati Team, we reached out to NITTE Meenakshi College for assistance. They graciously provided us access to a virtual Xeon server, a critical resource for our project's success.

However, the process was not straightforward. Accessing and utilizing the virtual Xeon server presented its own set of difficulties. Despite these challenges, we remained dedicated and persistent in our efforts. We collaborated closely, leveraging each team member's strengths, and worked diligently to overcome the technical barriers we encountered.
